#Algorithm:
  #Step 1: prompt the user for a width value then press enter
  #Step 2: prompt the user for a length value then press enter
  #Step 3: multiply the two values inputed 
  #Step 4: display the product which will be the area of the rectangle

#prompt the user for a width value then press enter
width = int(input("Enter a width: "))

#prompt the user for a length value then press enter
length = int(input("Enter a length: "))

#since we are finding the area of a rectangle these valuses will be multiplied and have a product

product = width * length

#then you will display this product value which is the area

print("The area of the rectangle is: ", product)
